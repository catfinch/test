# Test
Originally created as an empty project to figure out why my laptop wasn't working well with Github. Now is to test if non-master branches are Google searchable

If non of this text can be found through Google, I have permission to go back through old course work to practice and improve on a public repository. I plan on going through my data structures, algerithms, and programming languages courses
